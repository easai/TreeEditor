# TreeEditor
TreeEditor is an editor for 'hierarchical' data.

TreeEditor is a Java GUI component for editing tree structure.  It is a JScrollPane (as of TreeEditor ver. 0.1.0) derived and you can directly embed the component in your app.  I would suggest using JSplitPane.

Load the TreeEditor-0.1.0 library (if you are using Maven) as follows.
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.easai.utils</groupId>
            <artifactId>TreeEditor</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
